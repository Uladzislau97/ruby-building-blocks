# Ruby Building Blocks
##Solution of three classic "intro to programming" problems. 
### Caesar Cipher
"In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence."

Method #caesar_cipher takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string
###Stock Picker
Method #stock_picker takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0. 
###Substrings
Method #substrings takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
